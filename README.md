# TFIP Capstone: WeEat

## Motivation
I created this project to solve my girlfriend's question: "Where should we eat later?"

The idea was something that understands where we are heading to and what we are craving, then gives us food spot
suggestions that matches our preferences. Not quite another tool that searches Google for nearby restaurants with good 
ratings. I wanted it to be personal with only food spots we have added. Hence, can save food spots we want to try in the
future and later leave our own reviews after visiting them.


You might ask why not just rely on Google reviews?
- We have had plenty of experiences where a place with great online reviews didn't meet our expectations. No shade to anyone
 as everyone has different taste buds :)
- I wanted a way to keep track and ensure we visit the food spots shared by my girlfriend. Previously, 
this was done manually through an excel sheet.
- Searching on Google for food places usually bombards you with a ton of choices and many of these are not quite relevant.

## UI/UX decision
I decided to keep the frontend simple with a chatbot style of getting things done. When thinking of my own usage of the app
I would not be bothered and turned off if I had to learn and navigate through multiple pages of UI to get things done.
It should be as easy as texting someone.

(not the final outcome but was at least the vision)
